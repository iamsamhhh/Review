> > An unlabelled bottle contains a straight-chain halogenoalkane, P. The molecular formula of P is C₄H₉X, where X is a halogen; bromine, chlorine or iodine. 
> > - (a) A test is carried out to identify the halogen present in P. A sample of P is added to NaOH(aq) and warmed. Dilute nitric acid is then added followed by a few drops of aqueous silver nitrate. A cream precipitate is observed. 
> > - (i) Suggest the identity of X. [1] 
> > - (ii) Write an ionic equation to describe the formation of the cream precipitate. Include state symbols. [1] 
> > - (iii) Describe a further test which would confirm the identity of X。 [2]
