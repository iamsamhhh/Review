>  An unlabelled bottle contains a straight-chain halogenoalkane, P. The molecular formula of P is C₄H₉X, where X is a halogen; bromine, chlorine or iodine.
> > (b) The reaction of P with NaOH(aq) tends to proceed via an SN2 mechanism.
> > - (iii) Explain why the reaction tends to proceed via an SN2 mechanism rather than an SN1 mechanism. [2]
