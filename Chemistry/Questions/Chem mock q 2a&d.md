> 2 Nitric acid can be made from ammonia in a 3-stage process. 
> - Stage 1 Ammonia is oxidised by oxygen from the air, to form nitrogen monoxide and water. This reaction is carried out at 8 kPa and 900 °C in the presence of a platinum catalyst. 
>
>> 4NH₃ + 5O₂ → 4NO + 6H₂O Δ H = −905 kJ mol⁻¹
>
> - Stage 2 Nitrogen monoxide is cooled to 250 °C and reacts with more oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide. 
>
>> 2NO + O₂ → 2NO₂ Δ H = –114 kJ mol⁻¹ 
>
> - Stage 3 Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to make nitric acid and nitrogen monoxide. 
>
>> 3NO₂ + H₂O → 2HNO₃ + NO Δ H = −117 kJ mol⁻¹

>(a) 
> - i. Construct an overall balanced equation for the production of nitric acid from ammonia and oxygen. [1] 
> - ii. Calculate the overall enthalpy change for the production of 1 mole of nitric acid. [1]
