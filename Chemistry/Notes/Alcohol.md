## Making of alcohol
Nucleophilic substitution of haloalkane
oxidation of alkenes (use KMnO4)
Hydration of alkenes
Fermentation

## Physical properties
- Liquid: Contains hydrogen bonding => good solvent => liquid instead of gas

## Classification of alcohol
- Primary
	- OH connects to carbon that connect with one carbon only
- Secondary
	- OH connects to carbon that connect with two carbon
- Tertiary
	- OH connects to carbon that connect with three carbon

## Chemical properties
- Has two lone pairs: alcohols are base (lone pair donors/proton accepter)

### Reactions
- Combustion
- Substitution to give halogenoalkanes
- Reaction with sodium
- Oxidation to carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids
- Dehydration to alkenes (Elimination of water)
- Ester formation

#### Combustion
- Alcohols are good fuels
- Example: C2H5OH + 3(O2) -> 2(CO2) + 3(H2O)
- Advantage of Alcohols
	- high enthalpies
	- no sulphur => less pollution
	- obtained from renewable resources

#### Reaction with sodium
- Condition: s.t.p.
- Product: sodium alkoxide and hydrogen
- Example: 2(CH3CH2OH) + 2Na -> 2(CH3CH2O-Na+) + H2
	- CH3CH2O-Na+ => sodium ethoxide => Basic => ionic => solid => dissolves

#### Dehydration to alkenes (Elimination of water)
- Reagent/catalyst: conc. sulphuric acid or conc. phosphoric acid
- Condition: reflux at 180ËšC
- Product: alkene (primary creates only one isomers and secondary creates 3 isomers)
- Example: C2H5OH -> CH2CH2 + H2O

#### Bromination of alcohols
- reagents: conc. hydrobromic acid(HBr) or sodium/potassium bromide & conc. sulphuric acid
- Condition: reflux
- Product: halogenoalkane
- Example: C2H5OH + HBr(conc.) -> C2H5Br + H2O
#### Oxidation of alcohols
- Primary: Easily oxidised to aldehydes
	- Practical details:
		- Alcohol is dripped into a warm solution of acidified K2Cr2O7
		- aldehydes distilled off as low bp(no H-Bond)
	- Example: CH3CH2OH + \[O\] -> CH3CHO + H2O
	- Can further oxidise to carboxylic acid
		- Example: CH3CHO + \[O\] -> CH3COOH
	- Aldehydes have lower BP because it has no H-Bond
- Secondary: Easily oxidised to ketone
	- Only react once => oxidised to ketones **ONLY**
- Tertiary: **Cannot** be oxidised!
