# Graphics
## Bit-map image
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=31&selection=117,0,127,38&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.31]]
> > Bit-map images are made up of pixels (picture elements); the image is stored in a two-dimensional matrix of pixels.

## Vector  graphics
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=34&selection=23,0,27,60&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.34]]
> > Vector graphics are images that use 2D points to describe lines and curves and their properties that are grouped to form geometric shapes. 

> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=34&selection=33,0,61,75&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.34]]
> > A vector graphic will contain a drawing list (included in a file header) that is made up of
> > - the command used for each object that makes up the graphic image
> > - the attributes that define the properties that make up each object (for example consider the ellipse of the robot’s mouth – this will need the position of the two centres, the radius from centres, the thickness and style of each line, the line colour and any fill colour used)
> > - the relative position of each object will also need to be included
> > - the dimensions of each object are not defined, but the relative positions of objects to each other in the final graphic need to be defined; this means that scaling up the vector graphic image will result in no loss of quality.

# Sound

> >  **Sampling resolution** – number of bits used to represent sound amplitude (also known as bit depth). 
> >  **Sampling rate** – number of sound samples taken per second.

## Pros and cons of using higher Sampling resolution or rate
