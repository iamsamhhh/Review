# Validation
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=185&selection=75,0,79,69&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.185]]
> > **Validation** is a method of checking if entered data is reasonable (and within a given criteria), but it cannot check if data is correct or accurate. 

## Methods of validation
![[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=186&rect=183,200,576,726&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.186]]

# Verification
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=186&selection=244,0,248,79&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.186]]
> > Verification is a way of preventing errors when data is entered manually (using a keyboard, for example) or when data is transferred from one computer to another.

## Verification during data entry
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=186&selection=252,0,254,30&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.186]]
> > When data is manually entered into a computer it needs to undergo verification to ensure there are no errors.
> 
> 
### Double entry
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=187&selection=9,0,11,51&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.187]]
> > Data is entered twice, using two different people, and then compared (either after data entry or during the data entry process).
> 
> 

### Visual check
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=187&selection=15,0,17,71&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.187]]
> > Entered data is compared with the original document (in other words, what is on the screen is compared to the data on the original paper documents).

### Check digits
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=187&selection=21,0,51,61&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.187]]
> > The check digit is an additional digit added to a number (usually in the rightmost position). They are often used in barcodes, ISBNs (found on the cover of a book) and VINs (vehicle identification number). The check digit can be used to ensure the barcode, for example, has been correctly inputted. The check digit can catch errors including
> > - an incorrect digit being entered (such as 8190 instead of 8180)
> > - a transposition error where two numbers have been swapped (such as 8108 instead of 8180)
> > - digits being omitted or added (such as 818 or 81180 instead of 8180)
> > - phonetic errors such as 13 (thirteen) instead of 30 (thirty).

## Verification during data transfer
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=188&selection=38,0,42,28&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.188]]
> > When data is transferred electronically from one device to another, there is always the possibility of data corruption or even data loss. A number of ways exist to minimise this risk.
>

### Check sum
> [!PDF|] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=188&selection=131,0,141,57|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.188]]
> > When a block of data is about to be transmitted, the checksum for the bytes is first calculated. This value is transmitted with the block of data. At the receiving end, the checksum is re-calculated from the block of data received. This calculated value is compared to the checksum transmitted. If they are the same, then the data was transmitted without any errors; if they are different, then a request is sent for the data to be re-transmitted.

### Parity check
> [!PDF|] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=189&selection=17,0,32,29|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.189]]
> > A byte of data, for example, is allocated a parity bit. This is allocated before transmission. Systems that use even parity have an even number of 1-bits; systems that use odd parity have an odd number of 1-bits.

### Automatic repeat request (ARQ)
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=191&selection=137,0,189,71&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.191]]
> > Automatic repeat request (ARQ) is another method to check data following data transmission. This method can be summarised as follows:
> > - ARQ uses acknowledgement (a message sent to the receiver indicating that data has been received correctly) and timeout (the time interval allowed to elapse before an acknowledgement is received).
> > - When the receiving device detects an error following data transmission, it asks for the data packet to be re-sent.
> > - If no error is detected, a positive acknowledgement is sent to the sender.
> > - The sending device will re-send the data package if 
> > 	- it receives a request to re-send the data, or
> > 	- a timeout has occurred.
> > - The whole process is continuous until the data packet received is correct or until the ARQ time limit (timeout) is reached.
> > - ARQ is often used by mobile phone networks to guarantee data integrity.
