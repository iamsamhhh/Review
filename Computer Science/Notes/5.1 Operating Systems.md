### Definition
Operating system is a software that controls hardware and interact with application software.
### Why computer require an OS?
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=154&selection=63,39,73,22&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.154]]
> > An operating system provides both the environment in which applications can be run, and a useable interface between humans and computer. An operating system also disguises the complexity of computer hardware. 

#### User interface
- Provide an interface for the user to interact with the computer
- Graphic user interface(GUI)
	- Allow user to interact with computer using pictures or symbols.

- Command line interface(CLI)

### Tasks of Operating System(OS)

#### Memory management
 - Memory optimisation
	 - 
 - memory organisation
 - memory protection

#### Security management

#### Process management

> > A process is a program which is being run on a computer. Process management involves the allocation of resources and permits the sharing and exchange of data, thus allowing all processes to be fully synchronised 
> > - Examples: scheduling of resources, resolution of software conflicts, use of queues...

#### Hardware management
- OS handle the installation of the appropriate device driver.
