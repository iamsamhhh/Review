# Character representation
## ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

> > The standard ASCII code character set consists of 7-bit codes (0 to 127 denary or 0 to 7F in hexadecimal); this represents the letters, numbers and characters found on a standard keyboard together with 32 control codes (which use up codes 0 to 31 (denary) or 0 to 19 (hexadecimal)).

> > Extended ASCII uses 8-bit codes (128 to 255 in denary or 80 to FF in hex). This allows for non-English characters and for drawing characters to be included.

## Unicode

> > Unicode allows characters in a code form to represent all languages of the world, thus supporting many operating systems, search engines and internet browsers used globally. There is overlap with standard ASCII code, since the first 128 (English) characters are the same, but Unicode can support several thousand different characters in total. As can be seen in Tables 1.5 and 1.6, ASCII uses one byte to represent

> > - create a universal standard that covered all languages and all writing systems
> > - produce a more efficient coding system than ASCII
> > - adopt uniform encoding where each character is encoded as 16-bit or 32-bit code
> > - create unambiguous encoding where each 16-bit or 32-bit value always represents the same character (it is worth pointing out here that the ASCII code tables are not standardized and versions other than the ones shown in tables 1.5 and 1.6 exist)
> > - reserve part of the code for private use to enable a user to assign codes for their own characters and symbols (useful for Chinese and Japanese character sets).
