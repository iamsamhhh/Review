# Purpose and benefit of networking device
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=46&selection=31,0,94,8&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.46]]
> > Here are some of the main benefits of networking computers and devices (rather than using a number of stand-alone computers):
> > - Devices, such as printers, can be shared (thus reducing costs).
> > - Licences to run software on networks are often far cheaper than buying licences for an equivalent number of stand-alone computers.
> > - Users can share files and data.
> > - Access to reliable data that comes from a central source, such as a file server.
> > - Data and files can be backed up centrally at the end of each day.
> > - Users can communicate using email and instant messaging.
> > - A network manager can oversee the network and, for example, apply access rights to certain files, or restrict access to external networks, such as the internet. 
> > 
> > There are also a number of drawbacks:
> > - Cabling and servers can be an expensive initial outlay.
> > - Managing a large network can be a complex and difficult task.
> > - A breakdown of devices, such as the file servers, can affect the whole network.
> > - Malware and hacking can affect entire networks (particularly if a LAN is part of a much larger WAN), although firewalls do afford some protection in this respect.

# WAN and LAN
## Local area networks (LANs)
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=47&selection=37,6,58,53&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.47]]
> > A typical LAN consists of a number of computers and devices (such as printers) connected to hubs or switches. One of the hubs or switches is usually connected to a router and/or modem to allow the LAN to connect to the internet or become part of a wide area network (WAN).
### Wireless LANs (WLANs)
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=47&selection=62,1,93,54&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.47]]
> > **Wireless LANs (WLANs)** are similar to LANs but there are no wires or cables. In other words, they provide wireless network communications over fairly short distances (up to 100 metres) using radio or infrared signals instead of using cables. 
> > 
> > Devices, known as **wireless access points (WAPs)**, are connected into the wired network at fixed locations. Because of the limited range, most commercial LANs (such as those on a college campus or at an airport) need several WAPs to permit uninterrupted wireless communications. The WAPs use either spread spectrum technology (which is a wideband radio frequency with a range from a few metres to 100 metres) or infrared (which has a very short range of about 1 to 2 metres and is easily blocked, and therefore has limited use; see Section 2.1.5 Wired and wireless networking).

## Wide area networks (WANs)
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=48&selection=15,27,19,76&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.48]]
> > If a number of LANs are joined together using a router or modem, they can form a WAN. The network of automated teller machines (ATMs) used by banks is one of the most common examples of the use of a WAN.

# Client-server and peer-to-peer networking models
## Client server model
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=49&selection=7,0,105,43&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.49]]
> > - The client-server model uses separate dedicated servers and specific client workstations; client computers will be connected to the server computer(s).
> > - Users are able to access most of the files, which are stored on dedicated servers.
> > - The server dictates which users are able to access which files. **(Note: sharing of data is the most important part of the client-server model; with peer-to-peer, connectivity is the most important aspect.)**
> > - The client-server model allows the installation of software onto a client’s computer.
> > - The model uses central security databases which control access to the shared resources. (Note: passwords and user IDs are required to log into the network.)
> > - Once a user is logged into the system, they will have access to only those resources (such as a printer) and files assigned to them by the network administrator, so offers greater security than peer-to-peer networks.
> > - Client-server networks can be as large as you want them to be and they are much easier to scale up than peer-to-peer networks.
> > - A central server looks after the storing, delivery and sending of emails.
> > - This model offers the most stable system, for example, if someone deletes a shared resource from the server, the nightly back-up would restore the deleted resource (this is different in peer-to-peer – see later).
> > - Client-server networks can become bottlenecked if there are several client requests at the same time.
> > - In the client-server model, a file server is used and is responsible for 
> > 	- central storage and management of data files, thus enabling other network users to access files
> > 	- allowing users to share information without the need for offline devices (such as a memory stick) 
> > 	- allowing any computer to be configured as the host machine and act as the file server (note that the server could be a storage device (such as SSD or HDD) that could also serve as a remote storage device for other computers, thus allowing them to access this device as if it were a local storage device attached to their computer).

### Example of use
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=49&selection=113,0,135,57&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.49]]
> > - The company/user has a large user-base (however, it should be pointed out that this type of network model may still be used by a small group of people who are doing independent projects but need to have sharing of data and access to data outside the group).
> > - Access to network resources needs to be properly controlled.
> > - There is a need for good network security.
> > - The company requires its data to be free from accidental loss (in other words, data needs to be backed up at a central location).
>

## Peer-to-peer model
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=50&selection=27,0,87,18&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.50]]
> > On a peer-to-peer network, each node joins the network to allow
> > - the provision of services to all other network users; the services available are listed on a nominated ‘look up’ computer – when a node requests a service, the ‘look up’ computer is contacted to find out which of the other network nodes can provide the required service
> > - other users on the network to simply **access data from another node**
> > - **communication with other peers** connected to the network
> > - peers to be **both suppliers and consumers** (unlike the client-server model where consumers and resources are kept entirely separate from each other)
> > - peers to **participate as equals** on the network (again this is different to the client-server model where a webserver and client have different responsibilities).
> > 
> > The peer-to-peer model **does not have a central server**. Each of the nodes (workstations) on the network can share its files with all the other nodes, and each of the nodes will have its own data. Because there is no central storage, there is **no requirement to authenticate users.** This model is used in scenarios where no more than 10 nodes are required (such as a small business) where it is relatively easy for users to be in contact with each other on a regular basis. More than 10 nodes leads to performance and management issues.

> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=51&selection=7,0,15,33&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.51]]
> > Peer-to-peer **offers little data security** since there is no central security system. This means it is impossible to know who is authorised to share certain data. Users can create their own network node share point which is the only real security aspect since this gives them some kind of control. However, there are no real authentication procedures

# Thin client and Thick client

## Thin client
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=51&selection=64,0,78,69&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.51]]
> > A thin client is heavily dependent on having access to a server to allow constant access to files and to allow applications to run uninterrupted. A thin client can either be a device or software which needs to be connected to a powerful computer or server to allow processing to take place (the computer or server could be on the internet or could be part of a LAN/MAN/ WAN network). The thin client will not work unless it is connected at all times to the computer or server. A software example would be a web browser which has very limited functions unless it is connected to a server.

## Thick client
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=51&selection=90,0,106,52&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.51]]
> > A thick client can either be a device or software that can work offline or online; it is still able to do some processing whether it is connected to a server or not. A thick client can either be connected to a LAN/MAN/WAN, virtual network, the internet or a cloud computing server. A hardware example is a normal PC/laptop/tablet since it would have its own storage (HDD or SSD), RAM and operating system which means it is capable of operating effectively online or offline. An example of software is a computer game which can run independently on a user’s computer, but can also connect to an online server to allow gamers to play and communicate with each other

# Network topologies

## Bus
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=53&selection=13,0,49,74&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.53]]
> > **uses a single central cable** to which all computers and devices are connected. It is **easy to expand** and **requires little cabling**. **Data can only travel in one direction**; if data is being sent between devices then other devices cannot transmit. **Terminators** are needed at each end to **prevent signal reflection** (bounce). Bus networks are **typically peer-to-peer**. 
> > 
> > The disadvantages of a bus network include:
> > - If the **main cable fails**, the whole network goes down.
> > - The **performance** of the network **deteriorates**(恶化) under heavy loading.
> > - The network is **not secure** since each packet passes through every node.
> >
> > The advantages of a bus network include:
> > - Even if **one node fails**, the **remainder** of the network **continues to function**.
> > - It is **easy to increase the size** of the network by adding additional nodes.

> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=53&selection=59,0,63,75&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.53]]
> > In bus network topology, **each node** looks at **each packet** and determines whether or not the address of the recipient in the package matches the node address. If so, the node accepts the packet; if not, the packet is ignored.


## Star
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=53&selection=75,0,115,69&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.53]]
> > **uses a central hub/switch** and **each computer/device is connected to the hub/switch**. Data going from host to host is **directed through the central hub/switch**. Each computer/device **has its own dedicated connection to the central node** (hub/switch) – any type of network cable can be used for the connections (see Section 2.1.5 Wired and wireless networking). This type of network is **typically a client-server**.
> > 
> > The disadvantages of a star network include:
> > - The **initial** installation **costs are high**.
> > - If the **central hub/switch fails**, then the **whole network** goes down.
> > 
> > The advantages of a star network include:
> > - **Data collisions** are greatly **reduced** due to the topology.
> > - It is a **more secure** network since security methods can be applied to the central node and packets only travel to nodes with the correct address.
> > - It is **easy to improve** by simply installing an upgraded hub.
> > - If one of the connections is broken it only affects one of the nodes.
> 
> 

> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=53&selection=117,0,129,73&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.53]]
> > How packets are handled depends on whether the central node is a switch or a hub.
> > 
> > If it is a **hub**, **all the packets will be sent to every device/node** on the star network – if the address in the packet matches that of the node, it will be accepted; otherwise, it is ignored (this is similar to the way packets are handled on a bus network).
> > 
> > If the central node is a **switch**, packets will **only be sent to nodes where the address matches the recipient address in the packet.** The latter is clearly more secure, since only nodes intended to see the packet will receive it.


## Mesh
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=54&selection=17,0,67,41&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.54]]
> > There are two types of mesh network topologies: **routing** and **flooding**.
> > **Routing** works by giving the nodes routing logic (in other words, they act like a router) so that **data is directed to its destination by the shortest route** and **can be re-routed** if one of the nodes in the route has failed.
> > **Flooding** simply **sends the data via all the nodes** and uses no routing logic, which can **lead to unnecessary loading** on the network. It is a type of peer-to-peer network, but is fundamentally different.
> > 
> > The **disadvantages** of a mesh network include:
> > - A **large amount of cabling** is needed, which is **expensive** and time consuming.
> > - **Set-up and maintenance is difficult and complex.**
> > 
> > The **advantages** of a mesh network include:
> > - It is **easy to identify** where **faults** on the network have occurred.
> > - **Any broken links** in the network **do not affect the other nodes**.
> > - **Good privacy and security**, since packets travel along dedicated routes.
> > - The network is **relatively easy to expand.**

## Hybrid
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=55&selection=21,0,45,61&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.55]]
> > A hybrid network is a **mixture of two or more different topologies** (bus and star, bus and mesh, and so on). The main advantages and disadvantages **depend on which types of network are used** to make up the hybrid network, but an additional disadvantage is that they **can be very complex to install, configure and maintain**.
> > Additional advantages include:
> > - They can **handle large volumes of traffic.**
> > - It is **easy to identify** where a network **fault** has occurred.
> > - They are very **well suited** to the creation of **larger networks**.
