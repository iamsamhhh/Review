# Lossy Compression
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=37&selection=119,0,121,4&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.37]]
> > With this technique, the file compression algorithm eliminates unnecessary data

# File compression applications
## MPEG-3(MP3) and MPEG-4(MP4)
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=37&selection=147,0,157,68&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.37]]
> > MPEG-3 (MP3) uses technology known as audio compression to convert music and other sounds into an MP3 file format. Essentially, this compression technology will reduce the size of a normal music file by about 90%.

> > **Perceptual music shaping** removes certain sounds. For example
> > - frequencies that are outside the human hearing range
> > - if two sounds are played at the same time, only the louder one can be heard by the ear, so the softer sound is eliminated.


## Photographic (bit-map) images
JPEG - reduce the raw bit-map image by a factor of between 5 and 15

> > Vector graphics can also undergo some form of file compression. Scalable vector graphics (.svg) are defined in XML text files which, therefore, allows them to be compressed.

## Run-length encoding (RLE)
> [!PDF|yellow] [[Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science.pdf#page=38&selection=106,0,108,74&color=yellow|Hodder AS and A Levels Computer Science, p.38]]
> > It is a form of lossless/reversible file compression that reduces the size of a string of adjacent, identical data (such as repeated colours in an image).
